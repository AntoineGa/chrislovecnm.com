## About Me

Coding for over 20 years and contributing to Opensource projects. Currently
contributing to [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops), and other Kubernetes
projects. Architected critical projects with such companies as Datapipe,
Accenture, Motorola, ADP, Inuit, Warner Bros, and CenturyLink. Passionate about
scalable open source technologies, and not getting woken up at two in the
morning because a system went boom.  Outside of work, I can be found working on
OSS too much, enjoying time with wife, or passing on my love for the Martial
Arts through Kenpo.
