## About Me

Chris has been coding for over 20 years and is an open source contributor for Kubernetes. He is currently contributing to [kops](github.com/kubernetes/kops), and other Kubernetes projects. He has architected key projects with such companies as Datapipe, Accenture, Motorola, ADP, Inuit, Warner Bros, and CenturyLink. Chris is passionate about scalable open source technologies, and not getting woken up at two in the morning because a system went boom. Outside of work, Chris can be found working on his computer too much, enjoying time with wife, or passing on his love for the Martial Arts through Kenpo.
